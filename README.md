# py-playground

Simple Electron app inspired by Swift playgrounds in Xcode for use with Python

This was my first attempt at playing around with Electron, and getting more familiar with NodeJS.

Plenty of work to be done to make it better and more like the Swift playgrounds. I'd love to get more of the Atom editor functionality into this but maybe I would be better off building a plugin like this for Atom. Hmm...
